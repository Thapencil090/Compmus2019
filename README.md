The gorillaz have been a huge band since they started all the way back in 1998. They are based on cartoon characters drawn by Jamie Hewlett while the music is made by artist Damon Albarn. While he has been the composer and main vision behind gorillaz for more than 20 years their music is heavily influenced by the many collaborations they have with other artists like Snoop Dogg, De la Soul and Lou Reed. I want to take a look at the music they have made over the years and see if there is a common style that can be recognized through the different albums and collaborations that they have made. 

The first thing i notice is that their second to last album, Humanz, has been some of their least populair music, dredging the bottom of the popularity function on studio R, while their last album is still standing strong among their classic hits.

First I took a look at their least popular song that was an collaboration, that was Ascension Feat. Vince Staples and is shown next to the avarage and SD to see if we can find a reason why the song failed and is refered to as A. I will also be taking a look at their most popular colloborated song, humility and is referred to as H.

There were a couple of outliers in the data spotfify offered, after checking them out I found that they are all interludes, short audio as an opener for the album so these will not be taken into account for the future, as they skew the results of the avarage and SD. Also the collaboration function does not give faitfull results so i will have to make my own playlists, one with collaborations and one without, in order to ensure my data stays true.


Danceability
M	SD	A	H
0.61	0.185	0.691	0.632

Energy
M	SD	A	H
1 0.657 0.180	0.914	0.807

Valence
M	SD	A	H
0.516 	0.269 0.532	0.784

Tempo	
M	SD	A	H
120. 	33.4	152.1	160.174

liveness
M	SD	A	H
0.317 	0.283	0.229	0.125

The one big outlier we see in the found data is that A has a way higher energy than other gorillaz songs. 



For after looking at the results I feel it would be smart to no include their live perfomances in later weeks, as well as their album made using an ipad as these do not count as official releases.
